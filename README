DspUnit is system architectural framework for Digital Signal Processing on SoC.
It acts as processor peripheral and can be considered as a DSP accelerator.
DspUnit provides various classical signal operators and can be easily extended for
specific application purpose. Also, this component is bound to be connected to a processor. 

-------------------------------------------------
| TEST AND SIMULATION
-------------------------------------------------

DspUnit can be simulated using GHDL. For this purpose, ghdl and gtkwave software must be installed on your system.
A simulation bash script ./sim/sim is provided to easily run simulation on a UNIX platform.
To run DspUnit using the main testbench (bench_dspunit) run
    > cd sim
    > ./sim build dspunit
    > ./sim run dpunit
    > ./sim view dspunit

Other testbench are provided in the sim directory in order to test various operation sequences.
The bench_dspunit8 testbench is intended to test DspUnit with the regBtoW bridge for 8 bits buses.
